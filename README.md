## Wandering Trader  
A second attempt at the economy system I wrote some years ago. Partly I want to revisit the system because the last version was made in a few days over christmas and therefore wasn't very good. The other reason I want to revisit it, is that the system is a component of a larger project I am working on.  

The idea here is that in abstracting each main system out into a smaller project, I can finish each of them individually and then use each of those as a jumping off point for the main finished project.
